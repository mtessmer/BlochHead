# BlochHead
BlochHead is a Bloch sphere simulation package for pulsed EPR experiments. BlochHead uses the 
[PulseShape](https://gitlab.com/mtessmer/PulseShape) package to simulate different pulse shapes and the Bloch equations 
to simulate delays. The primary purpose of BlochHead is to create simulations that can be turned into videos for 
illustrative purposes.
